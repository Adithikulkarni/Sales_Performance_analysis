1. Data Cleaning:
   - Check for and handle missing values in the dataset.
   - Ensure data types are correct for each column.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Calculate basic statistics for the sales amount (mean, median, min, max).
   - Visualize the distribution of sales amounts using a histogram.
   - Explore the relationship between sales and product categories using bar charts or other appropriate visualizations.
   - Investigate any trends or patterns in sales over time using line plots or time series analysis.

3. Key Insights:
   - Identify the top-selling product categories and regions.
   - Determine if there are any seasonal trends in sales.
   - Recommend any actionable insights based on your analysis (e.g., focus marketing efforts in a particular region, adjust inventory for certain product categories).
